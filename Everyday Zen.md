# Everyday Zen

Date Read: January 2019

We all hope to change, to get somewhere! That in itself is the basic fallacy. But just contemplating this desire begins to clarify it, and the practice basis of your life begins to alter as we do so. We begin to comprehend that our frantic desire to get better, to "get somewhere" is illusion itself, and the source of suffering. -p24

Practice is about breaking our exclusive identification with ourselves. Purifying the mind. Stripping away that which keeps a person from functioning best. 

## The Fire of Attention
Hard coal - anthracite - burns clean. This is what we strive to "burn" our attention like.

Soft coal - lignite - is the reality of how we utilize our attention. Distracted, messy and impure, often wasteful. It simply means the burning in our life is not clean.

From the bible: *He is like a refiner's fire* - p31

Attention is rthe cutting, burning, and our practice is to use that word as much as we can. p32

Remain dispassionate and fundamentally unaffected by your thoughts.

Quiet the mind, increase the air intake, allow the fire to roar.

## Pushing for Enlightenment Experiences

Be patient. Having an "enlightenment" experience too soon is not necessarily healthy.

"On a withered tree, a flower blooms" -p39

The longer we practice, the more minimal this need becomes. The love becomes greater, and the need, less. We can't love something we need" -p.39

As we identify ourselves with less and less, we cam include more and more in our lives. -p39

## The Price of Practice

When life is unpleasant or unfulfilling, we use subtle escape mechanisms to avoid feeling pain or discomfort. In this way, we attempt to find somebody or something to handle our difficulties for us.

"As long as we see our lives in this dualistic fashion, we fool ourselves and believe that we need not pay any price for a realized life. We will continue to resist practive until we understand that only we cvan pay the price of realization." -p40

We never have a real practice until we realize our unwillingness to pay any price at all. Paying the price of practice is a privilege and we see this more clearly as our practice grows. In this process we discover that our own pain and others' pain are not separate worlds. The delusion of separateness diminishes.

## The Reward of Practice

To have a self means we are "self-centered". Rather than moving from unhappy self to happy self, Zen practice can help move one from unhappy self to no self, that which is joy. 

We must, however, have some degree of happiness and stability to engage in serious practice. In the next stage we begin to see the patterns, desires, and addictions that the self is composed of. We can then work to dissolve them. 

A life of joy is not in seeking happiness, but in experiencing and simply being the circumstances of our life as they are; not in fulfilling personal wants, but in fulfilling the needs of life; not in avoiding pain, but in being pain when it is necessary to do so. -p.45

# Feelings

## A Bigger Container

"The gateless gate"  
  
The overriding quality in any quarrel is pride. -p49 

On being angry - The first step is to back away, say little. -p50
Pride out of which anger is born is what separates us. -p51

What we want is not to be right, but to be a bigger container. The container is an analogy for how much life we can hold before the container overflows. As we strengthen our practice, our container grows.

What must be increased is our ability to observe. "If I can observe my mind and body in an angry state, who is this 'I' who observes. It shows me I am other than my anger, bigger than my anger. And this knowledge enables me to build a bigger container to grow." -p51
